# Introduction to Latent Class Analysis Workshop
Dr Roxanne Connelly, University of Edinburgh (roxanne.connelly@ed.ac.uk)

Many theoretical concepts in the social sciences cannot be easily observed directly. Latent class analysis is a statistical method for identifying unmeasured (i.e. latent) variables through the study of patterns in observed (i.e. manifest) variables. Latent class analysis is used to disentangle the heterogeneity of populations by identifying qualitatively different groups of individuals (i.e. latent classes). Latent class analysis has been used to identify patterns of substance misuse and antisocial behaviour, patterns in knowledge and attitudes towards social issues, voting patterns amongst members of parliament, patterns in educational test performance, and patterns of social media use. This workshop will introduce latent class analysis, and you will learn how to undertake and interpret analyses using this method.
